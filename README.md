# OpenGL Experiments
Features experimental code using OpenGL via GLEW, GLM, SDL2 and GLFW. The test code currently features, window creation, shader compilation, mesh creation (either through hard coaded vertices or by loading from obj file), support for textures, 3D motion (translation, rotation and scaling), a camera system with perspective projection and Lambertian shading for lighting. Since the purpose of this project is to experiment with OpenGL, 3rd party code for loading .obj files and images is used (stb_image.h, obj_loader.h and obj_loader.cpp). A test object and texture are provided in the resources file, along with a basic vertex and fragment shader.
